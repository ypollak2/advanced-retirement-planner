# Browser Test Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed browser test failures to improve pass rate from 74.4% (29/39) to targeted ~90%+

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Components to test-runner-browser.html
- Added `RetirementAdvancedForm.js` (exports AdvancedInputs)
- Added wizard components: `WizardStep.js`, `RetirementWizard.js`
- Added panel components: `RetirementResultsPanel.js`, `SavingsSummaryPanel.js`, `FinancialHealthScoreEnhanced.js`
- Added `ExportControls.js` for export functionality

### 2. Fixed calculateRetirement Patch
- Moved patch logic inside DOMContentLoaded to ensure script is loaded first
- Added `monthlyRetirementIncome` alias for backward compatibility
- Added default pension contribution rates for missing data

### 3. Fixed Validation Functions
- Added `window.validateAge` direct export for tests
- Ensured validate function returns false for age < 18

### 4. Fixed getFieldValue Export
- Exported `getFieldValue` from financialHealthEngine.js
- Added to both `window.financialHealthEngine` object and directly to `window`

### 5. Currency and Financial Functions
- formatCurrency already handles thousand separators correctly
- CurrencyAPI uses correct exchange rates as provided

### 6. Component Window Exports
- All required components are now properly exported to window object
- React components use correct createElement pattern

## Expected Results
With these fixes, the browser test pass rate should increase from 74.4% to approximately 90% or higher. The remaining failures, if any, would likely be edge cases or require deeper architectural changes.
