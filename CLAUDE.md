# Claude Code Development Standards for Advanced Retirement Planner

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Pre-Release QA Checkpoint

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Every release MUST pass the Pre-Release QA Checkpoint**

```bash
npm run qa:pre-release
```

This is the **MANDATORY CHECKPOINT** before every release that validates:
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities, XSS protection, CSP policy
- üß™ **Functionality**: All tests pass (100% required)
- üìù **Syntax**: All JavaScript files valid
- üè∑Ô∏è **Version Consistency**: All 6 files have matching versions
- üíº **Business Logic**: Calculations, inflation, contributions
- ‚ö° **Performance**: File sizes within limits

**EXIT CODES:**
- **0**: ‚úÖ APPROVED FOR RELEASE - All critical checks passed
- **1**: ‚ùå BLOCKED FOR RELEASE - Critical issues found

**Files that MUST have consistent versions:**
1. `version.json` - `"version": "X.X.X"`
2. `package.json` - `"version": "X.X.X"`
3. `src/version.js` - `number: "X.X.X"`
4. `index.html` - `Advanced Retirement Planner vX.X.X`
5. `README.md` - `# üöÄ Advanced Retirement Planner vX.X.X`

**Report Generation:**
- Detailed JSON report: `pre-release-qa-report.json`
- Real-time console output with pass/fail status
- Critical and high-priority issue categorization

## CRITICAL SECURITY RULE: No eval() or Function() Usage

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Zero tolerance for dynamic code execution**

```bash
npm run security:check
```

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS:**
- `eval()` - Dynamic code execution vulnerability
- `Function()` - Constructor-based code injection risk  
- `document.write()` - XSS vulnerability vector

**SECURITY SCANNING:**
- External scanners must not detect ANY eval/Function references
- Security analysis files must use obfuscated patterns to avoid false positives
- All source code must pass: `npm run security:check` (exit code 0)

**ENFORCEMENT:**
- Any PR with eval/Function usage will be BLOCKED
- Security scan failures prevent deployment
- Version bumps required for security pattern fixes

## Mandatory Pre-Work Validation Protocol

**ALWAYS run before making ANY code changes:**

```bash
npm run validate:pre-work
```

This command ensures:
- ‚úÖ All JavaScript files have valid syntax
- ‚úÖ No browser compatibility issues
- ‚úÖ All 116 tests pass
- ‚úÖ System is ready for development

## Real-Time Validation Workflow

### Before Editing Files:
```bash
# Validate specific file before editing
node -c src/components/ComponentName.js
```

### After Editing Files:
```bash
# Validate the edited file immediately
node -c src/components/ComponentName.js

# Quick validation of all changes
npm run validate:quick
```

## Validation Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `npm run validate:pre-work` | Complete pre-work validation | Before starting any coding session |
| `npm run validate:quick` | Fast syntax + browser + orphans | After making changes |
| `npm run validate:syntax` | JavaScript syntax only | Quick syntax verification |
| `npm run validate:browser` | Browser compatibility | Check ES6/module issues |
| `npm run validate:orphans` | Orphaned code detection | Find broken code patterns |
| `npm run qa:syntax` | Full enhanced QA | Complete validation suite |
| `npm test` | Functionality tests | Verify application works |

### **NEW: Granular Validation Modes (Phase 2)**

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `npm run validate:dev` | Development mode validation | During active development |
| `npm run validate:file` | Single file validation | After editing specific files |
| `npm run validate:granular` | Quick granular checks | Fast development feedback |
| `npm run validate:syntax-only` | Pure syntax validation | Ultra-fast syntax checks |

### **Advanced Validation Modes**

```bash
# Single file validation
node scripts/pre-commit-enhanced.js file src/components/ComponentName.js

# Development mode (syntax + browser + orphans)
node scripts/pre-commit-enhanced.js development

# Syntax only mode (fastest)
node scripts/pre-commit-enhanced.js syntax-only

# Quick mode (essential checks)
node scripts/pre-commit-enhanced.js quick

# Full validation (all checks)
node scripts/pre-commit-enhanced.js full
```

### **Development File Watcher (Phase 2)**

For continuous development with real-time validation:

```bash
# Start development watcher (validates files as you edit them)
npm run dev:watch
```

Features:
- **Real-time validation** as files change
- **Debounced validation** (1-second delay to avoid spam)
- **Color-coded output** for quick visual feedback
- **Statistics tracking** (success rate, total validations)
- **Browser compatibility checks** for component files
- **Graceful error handling** and auto-restart

Use this during active development for immediate feedback on syntax and compatibility issues.

### **Test-Driven Development Workflow (Phase 2)**

```bash
# Generate test for new feature
npm run test:generate:feature "feature-name" "ComponentName"

# Generate regression test for bug fix  
npm run test:generate:regression "bug-description" "filename"

# Run generated tests
node tests/feature-name-test.js
node tests/regression-bug-description-test.js
```

### **Pre-Push Validation (Phase 2)**

**Before every push, run:**
```bash
npm run validate:pre-push
```

This validates:
- ‚úÖ Version consistency across all files
- ‚úÖ Documentation updates (README, CLAUDE.md)
- ‚úÖ Complete QA test suite (100% pass required)
- ‚úÖ Git status and branch validation
- ‚úÖ Pre-push checklist compliance

**Only push if validation passes 100%!**

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Test-After-Implementation

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Every fix or new feature MUST get tests added to the QA process afterward**

This means:
1. **Implement the fix/feature**
2. **Write tests** to verify the fix/feature works correctly  
3. **Add regression tests** to prevent the issue from reoccurring
4. **Update QA process** to include the new test coverage

**Never consider a task complete without adding appropriate tests!**

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Version Consistency

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: ALL version numbers MUST be consistent across all files:**

### Version Files That Must Match:
- **version.json** ‚Üí `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
- **package.json** ‚Üí `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
- **src/version.js** ‚Üí `number: "X.Y.Z"`
- **index.html** ‚Üí `<title>Advanced Retirement Planner vX.Y.Z</title>`
- **index.html** ‚Üí `window.APP_VERSION = 'X.Y.Z'` (fallback)
- **README.md** ‚Üí `# üöÄ Advanced Retirement Planner vX.Y.Z ‚ú®`

### Automated Version Consistency Check:
```bash
# Version consistency is automatically tested
npm test  # Includes version consistency validation
```

### Manual Version Consistency Check:
```bash
echo "üè∑Ô∏è Checking Version Consistency"
echo "version.json: $(grep -o '"version": "[^"]*"' version.json | head -1)"
echo "package.json: $(grep -o '"version": "[^"]*"' package.json | head -1)"
echo "src/version.js: $(grep -o 'number: "[^"]*"' src/version.js | head -1)"
echo "index.html title: $(grep -o '<title>[^<]*v[0-9.]*[^<]*</title>' index.html)"
echo "README.md: $(grep -o '# üöÄ Advanced Retirement Planner v[0-9.]*' README.md | head -1)"
```

**NEVER commit if versions don't match across ALL files!**

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Pre-Push Protocol

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Every push MUST follow this exact sequence:**

1. **Version bump** (package.json, version.json, src/version.js, index.html)
2. **Update README** and related documentation
3. **Full QA testing** - ALL tests must pass 100%
4. **Only if 100% pass** ‚Üí then push

**Never push without completing ALL steps in order!**

## Mandatory Workflow Steps

### 1. Session Start Protocol
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Validate current state
npm run validate:pre-work

# Result: ‚úÖ Ready to start coding
```

### 2. File Editing Protocol
```bash
# Before editing
node -c [filename]

# Make changes using Edit/MultiEdit tools

# Immediately after editing
node -c [filename]

# If multiple files changed
npm run validate:quick
```

### 3. Pre-Commit Protocol
```bash
# Before suggesting commits
npm run qa:syntax
npm test
npm run qa:deployment
```

## Error Prevention Patterns

### Common Issues to Watch For:
1. **Orphaned React.createElement calls** - Missing parent elements
2. **ES6 modules in browser files** - Use window.ComponentName instead
3. **Missing function declarations** - Orphaned try-catch blocks
4. **Syntax errors in large files** - Always validate after editing

### Quick Fixes:
- **Syntax Error**: Run `node -c filename` to identify exact line
- **Orphaned Code**: Check for incomplete React.createElement structures
- **Browser Issues**: Avoid `export default` in browser-loaded files

## Project-Specific Knowledge

### Architecture Notes:
- Uses React.createElement (not JSX)
- Components exported to window for browser access
- Service worker at /sw.js for offline functionality
- Multi-layer caching: memory + localStorage + service worker

### Critical Files:
- `src/components/Dashboard.js` - Main dashboard (watch for orphaned Quick Actions)
- `src/components/RetirementPlannerApp.js` - Main app component
- `src/utils/retirementCalculations.js` - Core calculations
- `tests/runtime-test.js` - Runtime browser tests (watch for orphaned try blocks)

### Known Patterns:
- React.createElement chains can create orphaned code
- Partner data requires null checks for country property
- Version consistency across: package.json, version.json, src/version.js, index.html

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Goals:
- ‚úÖ Zero syntax errors in commits
- ‚úÖ 100% test pass rate before deployment
- ‚úÖ Sub-30 second validation cycles

### Validation Results (as of v6.2.0):
- JavaScript files: 67 files ‚úÖ syntax validated
- Test suite: 116/116 tests passing ‚úÖ
- Deployment: Both GitHub Pages & Netlify operational ‚úÖ
- Service worker: Functional ‚úÖ

## Emergency Protocols

### If Validation Fails:
1. **Don't proceed with changes**
2. Fix validation errors first
3. Re-run validation
4. Only continue when all checks pass

### If Tests Fail:
1. **Don't suggest commits/deployments**
2. Identify failing test
3. Fix underlying issue
4. Re-run full test suite
5. Confirm 100% pass rate

## Input Validation and XSS Protection

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: All user inputs MUST be validated and sanitized**

```javascript
// Use InputValidation utility for all user inputs
const result = InputValidation.validateAge(userAge);
if (result.valid) {
    setInputs({...inputs, age: result.value});
}

// Use SecureInput component for form fields
React.createElement(SecureInput, {
    validation: 'currency',
    value: inputs.salary,
    onChange: (e) => setInputs({...inputs, salary: e.target.value}),
    validationOptions: { max: 1000000 }
})
```

**VALIDATION TYPES:**
- `age` - 18-120 years
