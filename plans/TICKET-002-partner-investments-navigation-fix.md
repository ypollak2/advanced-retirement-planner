# TICKET-002: Partner Investments Navigation Fix

## Issue Description
The 'Next' button on the Partner Investments screen remains disabled even when valid values are shown in Expected Annual Return (%) fields. The button requires user interaction to enable, which is problematic when default values are already valid.

## Goal
Ensure the Next button works correctly regardless of whether the user changes any inputs, as long as valid defaults or inputs exist.

## Activation Conditions
- User is on the Partner Investments step
- Next button remains disabled even when valid values are shown in Expected Annual Return (%) fields

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Check Form Validation Logic
- [x] Locate the Partner Investments component (WizardStepInvestments.js)
- [x] Review current validation logic in RetirementWizard.js
- [x] Ensure form is marked as 'valid' when risk profiles and expected returns have values (even defaults)

### Step 2: Allow Navigation with Pre-filled Values
- [x] Modify validation to accept pre-loaded defaults (updated RetirementWizard.js)
- [x] Ensure Expected Annual Return (%) validates between 0 and 25 (expanded range)
- [x] Risk Profile must be selected (or have default)

### Step 3: Fix Next Button Enablement Condition
- [x] Review condition that requires 'dirty' state
- [x] Remove or loosen requirement for user interaction
- [x] Enable button based on form validity, not user changes

### Step 4: Test Scenarios
- [x] Test with typed values
- [x] Test with auto-filled default values
- [x] Test navigation without any user interaction
- [x] Test with invalid values to ensure validation still works

### Step 5: Trigger State on Component Mount
- [x] Add logic to check form validity on component mount (added useEffect)
- [x] Update button state immediately when component loads
- [x] Ensure state updates when default values are populated

## Validation Requirements
- Expected Annual Return must be a valid number between 0 and 25
- Risk Profile must be selected
- Both partners must have valid inputs

## UI Notes
Keep the UI logic simple - Next should be enabled if form inputs are complete and valid. Don't rely on user changes to trigger enablement.

## Expected Result
Next button becomes active and responsive once both partners have valid input or pre-filled values, even if user didn't modify them manually.

## Files to Modify
- `/src/components/wizard/steps/WizardStepInvestments.js`
- Possibly parent wizard component for navigation logic

## Status
**DONE** ✅

All implementation steps completed successfully:
- ✅ Added useEffect hook to initialize default values in WizardStepInvestments.js
- ✅ Modified validation logic in RetirementWizard.js to accept defaults without user interaction  
- ✅ Expanded valid range for expected returns from 0-20% to 0-25%
- ✅ All 354 tests passing - fix verified working correctly
- ✅ Next button now enables immediately with valid default values displayed
