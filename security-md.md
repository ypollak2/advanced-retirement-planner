# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

The Advanced Retirement Planner is designed with privacy and security as core principles. This document outlines our security measures, policies, and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Model

### Client-Side Architecture
- **No Backend Required**: All calculations performed in the user's browser
- **No Data Transmission**: No personal or financial data sent to external servers
- **No User Accounts**: No registration, login, or user management system
- **No Cookies**: No tracking cookies or persistent storage of personal data

### Data Privacy Principles
- **Local Processing Only**: All computations happen on the user's device
- **No Analytics**: No usage tracking, behavioral analytics, or data collection
- **No Third-Party Services**: No external APIs for financial data or calculations
- **Offline Capable**: Works completely offline after initial page load

## üîê Security Features

### Input Sanitization
```javascript
// Example: Input validation prevents XSS and injection
const sanitizeNumericInput = (value) => {
  // Remove non-numeric characters except decimal point
  const cleaned = value.toString().replace(/[^0-9.-]/g, '');
  const parsed = parseFloat(cleaned);
  
  // Validate range and return safe value
  return isNaN(parsed) ? 0 : Math.max(0, Math.min(parsed, MAX_SAFE_VALUE));
};
```

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
Recommended CSP headers for deployment:
```http
Content-Security-Policy: 
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://unpkg.com https://cdn.tailwindcss.com;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.tailwindcss.com;
  img-src 'self' data:;
  font-src 'self' data:;
  connect-src 'none';
  object-src 'none';
  media-src 'none';
  frame-src 'none';
```

### Secure Dependencies
All external libraries loaded from trusted CDNs with SRI (Subresource Integrity):
```html
<!-- Example with integrity checking -->
<script 
  src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-..." 
  crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
```

## üîç Vulnerability Assessment

### Potential Security Considerations

#### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Risk Level**: Low
**Mitigation**: 
- All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- React's built-in XSS protections active
- No dynamic HTML generation from user input

#### 2. Dependency Vulnerabilities  
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Minimal dependencies from trusted sources
- Regular updates of external libraries
- CDN-hosted libraries with integrity checking

#### 3. Client-Side Code Tampering
**Risk Level**: Low
**Impact**: Only affects individual user's calculations
**Mitigation**:
- Source code is open and auditable
- No critical security functions in client code
- Users can verify calculations independently

#### 4. Sensitive Data Exposure
**Risk Level**: Minimal
**Mitigation**:
- No persistent storage of financial data
- No network transmission of personal information
- Clear browser data to remove calculation history

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

We appreciate security researchers and users who help improve the security of our project. Please follow responsible disclosure practices:

#### How to Report
1. **Email**: Send details to `security@advanced-retirement-planner.com`
2. **GitHub**: Use the private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Issue**: Create a security issue (for non-sensitive vulnerabilities)

#### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue  
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if available)
- Your contact information for follow-up

#### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week  
- **Fix Development**: Based on severity (1-30 days)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available

### Severity Classification

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Complete system compromise
- Mass data exposure

**Response Time**: 24-48 hours

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)  
- Privilege escalation
- Significant data exposure
- Authentication bypass

**Response Time**: 1 week

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Limited data exposure
- Denial of service
- Input validation issues

**Response Time**: 2 weeks

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Information disclosure
- Minor security misconfigurations
- Non-exploitable issues

**Response Time**: 1 month

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Users

### Recommended Usage
1. **Use Official Sources**: Download only from official GitHub repository
2. **Verify Integrity**: Check file hashes when possible
3. **Keep Updated**: Use the latest version for security fixes
4. **Secure Environment**: Use updated browsers with security patches

### Data Protection
1. **Clear Browser Data**: Regularly clear browser cache and data
2. **Use Incognito/Private Mode**: For sensitive financial planning
3. **Secure Device**: Ensure your device has updated security software
4. **Network Security**: Use secure, trusted internet connections

### Sharing Calculations
1. **Remove Personal Data**: Clear sensitive information before sharing
2. **Screenshot Safely**: Blur or remove identifying information
3. **Use Generic Examples**: Replace real data with sample values
4. **Secure Communication**: Use encrypted channels for sharing results

## üîí Security for Developers

### Development Environment Security
```bash
# Use package-lock.json for dependency integrity
npm ci

# Audit dependencies regularly  
npm audit

# Update dependencies with security fixes
npm update
```

### Secure Coding Practices
1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs client-side
2. **Output Encoding**: Properly encode all displayed data
3. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
4. **Code Review**: Review all changes for security implications

### Deployment Security
1. **HTTPS Only**: Deploy with SSL/TLS encryption
2. **Security Headers**: Implement CSP, HSTS, and other security headers
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep web server and platform updated
