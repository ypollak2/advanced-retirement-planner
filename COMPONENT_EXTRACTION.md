    setInputs={setInputs}
    language={language}
    t={translations}
    Calculator={CalculatorIcon}
    PiggyBank={PiggyBankIcon}
    DollarSign={DollarSignIcon}
/>
```

2. **As an inline component** (in HTML with CDN React):
```javascript
React.createElement(BasicInputs, {
    inputs: inputs,
    setInputs: setInputs,
    language: language,
    t: t,
    Calculator: Calculator,
