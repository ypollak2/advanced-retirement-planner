- [x] Ceiling implementation (â‚ª15,972)
- [x] Above ceiling contribution option
- [x] No training fund option
- [x] Future value calculations
- [x] Input validation

### ðŸŽ¯ Manual UI Testing Required

#### 1. Training Fund Form Elements

  - Test: With â‚ª20,000 salary, should show â‚ª2,000 when checked

#### 2. Calculation Accuracy
- [ ] **Under Ceiling Test**: 
  - Set salary: â‚ª10,000
  - Expected training fund: â‚ª1,000 (10%)
  
- [ ] **At Ceiling Test**:
  - Set salary: â‚ª15,972 (exact ceiling)
  - Expected training fund: â‚ª1,597.20 (10%)
  
- [ ] **Above Ceiling Test (Standard)**:
  - Set salary: â‚ª20,000
  - Uncheck "Contribute Above Ceiling"
  - Expected training fund: â‚ª1,597.20 (10% of ceiling only)
  
- [ ] **Above Ceiling Test (Full)**:
  - Set salary: â‚ª20,000
  - Check "Contribute Above Ceiling"
  - Expected training fund: â‚ª2,000 (10% of full salary)

#### 3. Results Display
- [ ] **Training Fund Results**: Verify training fund savings are displayed correctly in results
