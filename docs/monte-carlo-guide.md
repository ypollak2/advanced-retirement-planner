# Monte Carlo Simulation Guide

## Overview

The Monte Carlo simulation feature provides probabilistic analysis of retirement outcomes by running thousands of scenarios with different market conditions, inflation rates, and economic cycles.

## How It Works

### Simulation Process

1. **Parameter Setup**: Define simulation count (1,000 to 25,000), projection years (10-50), and confidence levels
2. **Market Modeling**: Generate random returns based on historical volatility and correlation
3. **Economic Scenarios**: Include recession, expansion, stagflation, and normal market conditions
4. **Portfolio Evolution**: Track portfolio value through time with regular contributions and market movements
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate success rates, risk metrics, and confidence intervals

### Economic Scenarios

**Four Economic Conditions** (each with 25% probability):

1. **Bull Market**: 12% annual returns, low volatility
2. **Bear Market**: -5% annual returns, high volatility  
3. **Recession**: -15% first year, gradual recovery
4. **Stagflation**: 3% returns, high inflation (4-6%)

### Risk Metrics

**Success Probability**: Percentage of simulations meeting retirement goals
- **Excellent**: >85% success rate
- **Good**: 70-85% success rate
- **Fair**: 55-70% success rate
- **Poor**: <55% success rate

**Value at Risk (VaR)**: Portfolio loss not exceeded 95% of the time
- VaR95: Maximum loss in 95% of scenarios
- VaR99: Maximum loss in 99% of scenarios

**Expected Shortfall**: Average loss in worst-case scenarios
- Measures tail risk beyond VaR
- Critical for risk management

**Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- P50: Median drawdown across simulations
- P90: 90th percentile drawdown (worst 10%)

## Using the Dashboard

### Running Simulations

1. **Access**: Navigate to Monte Carlo Results Dashboard
2. **Configure**: Adjust simulation parameters in settings panel
3. **Execute**: Click "Run Simulation" button
4. **Analysis**: Review results in multiple view modes

### View Modes

**Histogram View**: 
- Distribution of final portfolio values
- Visual representation of outcome probabilities
- Color-coded success/failure regions

**Time Series View**:
- Portfolio evolution over projection period
- Confidence bands (10th-90th percentiles)
- Median trajectory line

**Risk Analysis View**:
- Detailed risk metrics grid
- Value at Risk calculations
- Drawdown analysis
- Expected shortfall metrics

### Interpretation Guidelines

**Success Rate Interpretation**:
- **>85%**: Very high confidence in retirement goals
- **70-85%**: Good likelihood with some risk
- **55-70%**: Moderate success, consider adjustments
- **<55%**: High risk, significant changes needed

**Portfolio Value Analysis**:
- **Median Value**: Expected outcome (50th percentile)
- **10th Percentile**: Conservative planning scenario
- **90th Percentile**: Optimistic scenario
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of outcome variability

## Advanced Features

### Inflation Adjustment

All simulation results are presented in real (inflation-adjusted) terms:
- **Nominal Values**: Raw future dollar amounts
- **Real Values**: Purchasing power equivalent to today's dollars
- **Inflation Scenarios**: Variable inflation rates in simulations

### Israeli Tax Integration

Simulations include Israeli-specific tax considerations:
- **Pension Withdrawals**: Tax-deferred growth with withdrawal taxation
- **Training Fund**: Tax-free withdrawals after age 60
- **Portfolio Gains**: Capital gains tax on non-retirement accounts

### Correlation Modeling

Simulations model realistic correlations between:
- **Asset Classes**: Stocks, bonds, real estate, international
- **Economic Factors**: Inflation, interest rates, GDP growth
- **Time Dependencies**: Market cycles and mean reversion

## Optimization Recommendations

### Based on Results

**Low Success Rate (<70%)**:
1. Increase contribution rates
2. Extend working years
3. Reduce retirement spending target
4. Increase portfolio risk allocation
5. Consider additional income sources

**High Risk Metrics**:
1. Diversify across asset classes
2. Consider international exposure
3. Implement rebalancing strategy
4. Review withdrawal strategy
5. Build larger emergency fund

**High Income Volatility**:
1. Implement bucket strategy for withdrawals
2. Consider annuity for base income
3. Maintain higher cash reserves
4. Plan flexible spending in retirement

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimization

- **Efficient Algorithms**: Optimized random number generation
- **Parallel Processing**: Web Workers for large simulations (future)
- **Memory Management**: Efficient data structures for large datasets
- **Progressive Results**: Display results as simulation progresses

### Accuracy Validation

- **Historical Backtesting**: Validation against historical market data
- **Statistical Tests**: Chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
- **Cross-Validation**: Results compared with academic models
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Parameter robustness testing

## Best Practices

### Simulation Configuration

**Simulation Count**:
- **1,000**: Quick analysis, approximate results
- **5,000**: Good balance of speed and accuracy
- **10,000**: Recommended for planning decisions
- **25,000**: High precision for critical analysis

**Projection Period**:
- **Minimum**: 10 years for short-term planning
- **Standard**: 30 years for full retirement planning
- **Extended**: 40-50 years for early retirement

### Result Interpretation

1. **Focus on Medians**: More robust than means for skewed distributions
2. **Consider Ranges**: Plan for 10th-90th percentile outcomes
3. **Regular Updates**: Rerun simulations annually or after major life changes
4. **Scenario Testing**: Test different contribution and spending scenarios

### Integration with Planning

- **Use with Other Tools**: Combine with stress testing and goal tracking
- **Document Assumptions**: Record simulation parameters for future reference
- **Action Planning**: Convert results into specific planning actions
- **Monitor Progress**: Track actual results vs simulation predictions
