# Salary & Income Page Fixes Documentation

## Date: 2025-08-04
## Version: 7.5.9

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Other Income Field Not Affecting Total Calculation ✅

**Problem:** The "Other Income" field in the Salary & Income page was not being included in the combined total income calculation.

**Root Cause:** In `src/utils/additionalIncomeTax.js`, the `calculateTotalAdditionalIncomeTax` function was not including the `inputs.otherIncome` field in its calculations.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `otherIncomeAmount` variable to capture `inputs.otherIncome` (line 271)
- Included it in the total annual income calculation (line 275)
- Added it to the otherIncome aggregate for tax calculations (line 287)
- Updated the return statement to include it in totalAdditionalIncome (line 293)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/additionalIncomeTax.js`

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before (missing otherIncome)
const otherIncome = freelanceIncome + rentalIncome + dividendIncome;

// After (includes otherIncome)
const otherIncomeAmount = (parseFloat(inputs.otherIncome) || 0) * 12;
const otherIncome = freelanceIncome + rentalIncome + dividendIncome + otherIncomeAmount;
```

### 2. RSU Stock Options Enhancement ✅

**Problem:** User requested 500+ stock tickers and better manual price entry visibility.

**Current State Analysis:**
- ✅ Already had 500+ stocks available in `src/data/stockCompanies.js`
- ✅ Manual price entry already existed but wasn't prominent
- ⚠️ UI didn't clearly guide users to manual option when stock not found

**Solution Implemented:**

#### UI Improvements in Both RSU Selectors:
1. **Enhanced "Other Company" Option:**
   - Changed text from "Other Company" to "Can't find your company?"
   - Updated description to "Click here to enter stock price manually"
   - Added yellow background for better visibility

2. **Improved No Results Experience:**
   - Dropdown now shows even when no results found
   - Added message: "No results found - choose option below"
   - Guides users directly to manual entry option

3. **Better Manual Price Visibility:**
   - Manual/API toggle button already present
   - Custom ticker entry with validation
   - Clear price input field with currency symbol

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/shared/EnhancedRSUCompanySelector.js`
- `src/components/shared/PartnerRSUSelector.js`
