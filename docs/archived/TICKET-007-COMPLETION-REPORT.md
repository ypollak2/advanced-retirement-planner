# TICKET-007: Financial Health Score Correlation Fix - Completion Report

## Summary
Successfully fixed the financial health score correlation issues where scores were showing 0% despite valid data being entered in couple planning mode.

## Problems Addressed
1. **Field Name Mismatch**: Wizard saved `partner1NetSalary`/`partner2NetSalary` but scoring engine expected different field names
2. **Net vs Gross Confusion**: Scoring engine expected gross salaries but wizard provided net values
3. **Missing Income Sources**: Bonus and other income weren't properly aggregated
4. **Missing Contribution Rates**: Default rates weren't applied when not specified

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Field Mapping (financialHealthEngine.js)
- Added comprehensive partner field mapping arrays
- Support for multiple field name variations (NetSalary, NetIncome, BonusAmount, etc.)
- Proper partner value combination logic

### 2. Gross Salary Calculation
- Added `calculateGrossFromNet()` function using binary search with TaxCalculators
- Fallback calculation using average tax rates by country
- Automatic gross calculation when only net values available

### 3. Income Aggregation
- Detect and sum bonus income from multiple field variations
- Include RSU income calculations (units × price × frequency)
- Aggregate all "other income" sources

### 4. Default Contribution Rates
- Apply 17.5% pension rate when not specified
- Apply 7.5% training fund rate when not specified
- Use actual amounts if rates not available

## Test Results
- **Internal Tests**: 302/302 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Production E2E Tests**: Created test-production-financial-health.html with 5 comprehensive test cases
