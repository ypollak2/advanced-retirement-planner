## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Code Architecture Review ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Architecture Pattern:** Component-based React application using window exports for GitHub Pages compatibility

**Strengths:**
- **Consistent Architecture:** All components follow `window.ComponentName` export pattern
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Utils, components, data, and translations properly separated
- **Dependency Management:** Careful script loading order prevents dependency issues
- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintains compatibility with older browsers

**File Structure Assessment:**
```
src/
├── components/         # 40+ React components (well-organized)
├── utils/             # 35+ utility functions (comprehensive)
├── data/              # Static constants and market data
├── translations/      # Multi-language support
└── styles/           # CSS styling
```

### 2. Security Analysis 🔒

**Security Score: 8.5/10**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **No exposed API keys** or secrets in frontend code
- ✅ **Input validation** implemented for financial calculations
- ✅ **CORS-aware API implementations**
- ✅ **XSS prevention** using textContent instead of innerHTML
- ✅ **Domain whitelist** for external API calls

**Critical Security Issues:**

#### 🔴 Missing Subresource Integrity (SRI)
**File:** `src/utils/exportFunctions.js:278,294`
```javascript
script.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html2canvas/1.4.1/html2canvas.min.js';
script.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js';
```
**Risk:** External scripts loaded without integrity checks
**Recommendation:** Add SRI hashes to prevent CDN compromise attacks

#### 🟡 NPM Audit Vulnerabilities
**Dependencies:** esbuild ≤0.24.2, vite 0.11.0 - 6.1.6
**Severity:** Moderate (development-only dependencies)
**Recommendation:** Update dependencies or accept risk for dev-only tools

### 3. Performance Analysis ⚡

**Performance Score: 9.0/10**

**Excellent Performance Features:**
- ✅ **Sophisticated Caching:** 5-minute TTL with intelligent cache keys
- ✅ **Memoization:** Expensive calculations cached automatically  
- ✅ **Lazy Loading:** Components loaded on demand
- ✅ **CDN Usage:** External libraries loaded from CDN
- ✅ **Minimal Bundle Size:** 16.5KB HTML, optimized script loading

**Performance Optimization Features:**
```javascript
// Advanced caching system
const calculationCache = new Map();
const CACHE_TTL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes

// Performance monitoring
const performanceMetrics = {
    cacheHits: 0,
    cacheMisses: 0,
    totalCalculationTime: 0
};
```

**Areas for Improvement:**
- 🟡 **Cache size management** could be memory-based rather than count-based
- 🟡 **Web Workers** could handle heavy financial calculations
- 🟡 **Service Worker** for offline functionality

### 4. Code Quality Assessment 📋

**Quality Score: 8.7/10**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Consistent Coding Style:** Follows project conventions throughout
- ✅ **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Try/catch blocks in critical functions
- ✅ **Input Validation:** Financial calculations protected against invalid data
- ✅ **Modular Design:** Clear separation between calculation engines
- ✅ **Documentation:** Good inline comments and function documentation

**Code Quality Examples:**

#### Excellent Error Handling Pattern:
```javascript
// src/utils/retirementCalculations.js:44-48
if (!currency || !exchangeRates[currency] || exchangeRates[currency] === 0) {
    const rateValue = exchangeRates[currency];
    console.warn(`Exchange rate for ${currency} is invalid:`, rateValue);
    return 'N/A';
}
```

#### Sophisticated Financial Logic:
```javascript
// Complex partner planning calculations with proper validation
function getFieldValue(fieldName, inputs, options = {}) {
    const { combinePartners = false, allowZero = false } = options;
    
    if (inputs.planningType === 'couple' && combinePartners) {
        // Combine partner values with validation
        return combinePartnerFields(fieldName, inputs, allowZero);
    }
    
    return inputs[fieldName];
}
```

## Critical Recommendations

### High Priority (Fix Immediately)

1. **Add Subresource Integrity (SRI) for External Scripts**
   ```javascript
   script.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html2canvas/1.4.1/html2canvas.min.js';
   script.integrity = 'sha384-[HASH]';
   script.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';
   ```

2. **Address NPM Security Vulnerabilities**
   ```bash
   npm audit fix --force
   # Or update vite to latest stable version
   ```

### Medium Priority (Plan for Next Sprint)

3. **Simplify Performance Optimizer Recursion Logic**
   - Current complexity: 270 lines with recursive guards
   - Recommendation: Extract to smaller, testable functions

4. **Implement Memory-Based Cache Management**
   ```javascript
   // Instead of hard-coded 100 items limit
   if (getMemoryUsage() > MAX_CACHE_MEMORY) {
       cleanupCache();
   }
   ```

5. **Add Web Workers for Heavy Calculations**
   - Monte Carlo simulations
   - Complex partner planning calculations
   - Large dataset processing

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)
