# TICKET-006: Comprehensive E2E Testing for Financial Health Scoring

**Created:** 2025-08-01  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Testing & Quality Assurance

## Executive Summary

Create a comprehensive E2E testing framework that validates the financial health scoring mechanism across 80 different scenarios, ensures data persistence through the 9-step wizard, and addresses all critical issues reported with the scoring system.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues:
1. **Critical Low Scores (27-29)**: The scoring consistently returns critically low scores regardless of input
2. **FIELD_MAPPINGS Conflicts**: Duplicate declarations causing JavaScript errors  
3. **Data Not Persisting**: Fields not mapping correctly between wizard steps and scoring engine
4. **Session Storage Issues**: Debugging visibility problems with cached data
5. **Couple Mode Failures**: Partner data not combining properly for calculations

### Requirements:
- Test scoring mechanism across 80 different user scenarios
- Validate data persistence through all wizard steps
- Export detailed logs for debugging
- Ensure all previous complaints are addressed

## Solution Design

### 1. Comprehensive E2E Test Suite (`tests/e2e/financial-health-e2e-suite.html`)
- 80 test scenarios covering all user types and edge cases
- Real-time test execution in browser environment
- Detailed logging with session tracking
- Export functionality for test results

### 2. Test Scenario Categories (80 scenarios total)

#### Individual Planning (20 scenarios)
- Young professionals (age 25-35)
- Mid-career (age 36-50)  
- Pre-retirement (age 51-65)
- Edge cases (missing data, extreme values)

#### Couple Planning (20 scenarios)
- Dual income couples
- Single income couples
- Mixed nationality couples
- Age gap scenarios

#### Data Persistence Tests (15 scenarios)
- Step-by-step data validation
- Save/resume functionality
- Field mapping integrity
- Currency conversions

#### Edge Cases (15 scenarios)
- Zero values
- Missing critical fields
- Extreme high/low values
- Invalid data types

#### Scoring Factor Tests (10 scenarios)
- Each of the 8 scoring factors isolated
- Combined factor interactions
- Threshold validations

### 3. Test Components

#### Test Data Generator (`tests/e2e/test-data-generator.js`)
- Generates realistic test data for all 80 scenarios
- Includes expected score ranges
- Validates field mappings
- Supports both individual and couple modes

#### Field Mapping Validator (`tests/e2e/field-mapping-validator.js`)
- Validates all field name variations
- Tests partner field combinations
- Ensures data flows correctly through wizard steps
- Identifies missing field mappings

#### Score Validation Engine (`tests/e2e/score-validator.js`)
- Validates score calculations against expected ranges
- Checks each scoring factor independently
- Ensures no "critical low" scores for valid data
- Identifies calculation errors

#### Test Logger and Reporter (`tests/e2e/test-reporter.js`)
- Comprehensive logging system
- Session-based tracking
- Export to JSON/CSV/Markdown
- Visual test results dashboard
- Error stack traces and debugging info

#### Automated Test Runner (`tests/e2e/run-all-tests.js`)
- Command-line test execution
- Parallel test running
- Progress tracking
- Failure recovery
- CI/CD integration ready

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
- [ ] Create main E2E test suite HTML file
- [ ] Implement test data generator with 80 scenarios
- [ ] Build basic test execution framework

### Phase 2: Validation Engine (Week 1)
- [ ] Implement field mapping validator
- [ ] Create score validation engine
- [ ] Add expected score range calculations

### Phase 3: Logging & Reporting (Week 2)
- [ ] Build comprehensive test logger
- [ ] Implement export functionality
- [ ] Create visual dashboard

### Phase 4: Automation & Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] Create automated test runner
- [ ] Add CI/CD integration
- [ ] Document test execution process

## Test Execution Flow

1. **Initialize Test Environment**
   - Load test framework
   - Initialize logging system
   - Prepare test scenarios

2. **Execute Test Scenarios**
   ```
   For each scenario:
     - Load test data
     - Initialize wizard with data
     - Progress through all 9 steps
     - Validate data at each step
     - Calculate financial health score
     - Validate score against expected
     - Log results and errors
   ```

3. **Generate Reports**
   - Test execution summary
   - Failed test details
   - Field mapping report
   - Score validation report

4. **Export Results**
   - JSON with full test data
   - CSV summary
   - Markdown report

## Expected Deliverables

1. **80 Comprehensive Test Scenarios** with realistic data
2. **Real-time Test Dashboard** showing progress and results
3. **Detailed Test Logs** exported with:
   - Input data for each scenario
   - Expected vs actual scores
   - Field mapping validations
   - Error traces
   - Performance metrics
4. **Field Mapping Report** showing data flow
5. **Score Validation Report** with factor breakdowns
6. **Fix Verification** for all reported issues

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 80 scenarios execute without JavaScript errors
- [ ] No "critical low" scores (27-29) for valid data  
- [ ] Data persists correctly through all wizard steps
- [ ] Field mappings work for both individual and couple modes
- [ ] Comprehensive logs available for debugging
- [ ] All previous complaints addressed and verified fixed
- [ ] Test suite runs in under 5 minutes
- [ ] Export functionality works for all formats

## Technical Requirements

- Browser-based execution (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- No external dependencies beyond application code
- Real-time progress indication
- Failure recovery mechanisms
- Session-based logging
- Export to multiple formats

## Risk Mitigation

- **Test Data Quality**: Use realistic data based on actual user patterns
- **Performance**: Implement parallel test execution where possible
- **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging at every step
- **Maintenance**: Well-documented test scenarios and expected outcomes

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of core test infrastructure
2. Create initial set of test scenarios
3. Validate approach with stakeholder
4. Iterate based on initial findings
