## 🛠️ New Tools Created

1. **Browser Test Runner** (`test-runner-browser.html`)
   - Run with: `npm run test:browser:serve` then open http://localhost:8080/test-runner-browser.html
   - Tests components in real browser environment
   - Catches runtime errors like the CurrencyAPI issue

2. **Production Scanner** (`test-production-issues.html`)
   - Comprehensive scan for production issues
   - Checks all critical components
   - Monitors console errors and warnings

3. **Production Readiness Check** (`production-readiness-check.js`)
   - Run with: `node production-readiness-check.js`
   - Automated check of all deployment requirements
   - Generates detailed report

## 📋 Deployment Steps

1. **Final verification**:
   ```bash
   npm test  # Should show 373/373 tests passing
   node production-readiness-check.js  # Should show "PRODUCTION READY"
   ```

2. **Deploy to production**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:production
   ```

3. **Post-deployment verification**:
   - Visit: https://ypollak2.github.io/advanced-retirement-planner/
   - Test RSU components work without errors
   - Verify currency conversion works
   - Check couple mode calculations

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Primary Issue: CurrencyAPI Method Mismatch
- **Problem**: Components called `api.getExchangeRates()` but method was `api.fetchExchangeRates()`
- **Impact**: Runtime error preventing RSU components from working
- **Solution**: Updated method calls in both RSU components
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `src/components/shared/EnhancedRSUCompanySelector.js`
  - `src/components/shared/PartnerRSUSelector.js`

### Why It Wasn't Caught Earlier
- Static tests don't execute React hooks or API calls
- E2E tests weren't running actual browser code
- Now fixed with comprehensive browser test suite
