# E2E API Test Findings Report

**Date:** 2025-07-30  
**Test Results:** 8/10 Passed (80% Success Rate)  
**Test File:** production-api-tests.html

## Summary

The E2E API tests revealed calculation inconsistencies in the financial health scoring system. While field mapping and basic calculations work correctly, the scoring algorithms produce unrealistic results.

## Key Findings

### 1. ✅ Working Correctly
- **Field Mapping**: Alternative field names (partner1NetIncome, etc.) are properly detected
- **Net Salary Calculations**: Gross-from-net conversions work correctly
- **Multi-Country Tax**: Different tax rates apply correctly (IL: 25%, UK: 28%, US: 24%)
- **Additional Income**: Bonuses and RSU income are included in calculations
- **Zero Income Handling**: Edge case handled gracefully

### 2. ❌ Issues Found

#### A. Savings Rate Always 100%
**Problem**: Tests 1, 2, 4 all show 100% savings rate, which is unrealistic  
**Root Cause**: The calculation uses `savingsRate * 4` to get the score, meaning 25% savings = 100 score  
**Impact**: Inflated financial health scores

**Fix Required in financialHealthEngine.js**:
```javascript
// Current (too generous):
const savingsRateScore = Math.min(100, Math.max(0, savingsRate * 4));

// Should be more realistic:
const savingsRateScore = Math.min(100, Math.max(0, savingsRate * 2.5)); // 40% savings = 100 score
```

#### B. Young Professional Score Too High (82)
**Problem**: 25-year-old with minimal savings (17k total) gets 82/100 score  
**Root Cause**: Long time horizon (42 years) inflates projections unrealistically  
**Expected**: 30-60 range for someone just starting out

**Fix Required**:
- Factor in current savings vs income ratio
- Weight current position more heavily than projections
- Consider age-appropriate benchmarks

#### C. Pre-Retirement Score Too Low
**Problem**: Couple with 4.3M savings 3 years from retirement scores < 50%  
**Root Cause**: High expenses (600k/year) and short time horizon  
**Issue**: Retirement goal calculation uses 20 years × annual expenses = 12M goal

**Fix Required**:
```javascript
// Adjust retirement goal based on existing savings and time
const yearsInRetirement = Math.max(20, 85 - inputs.targetRetirementAge);
const adjustedGoal = monthlyExpenses * 12 * yearsInRetirement * 0.8; // 80% due to reduced expenses in retirement
```

## Detailed Test Results Analysis

| Test | Result | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Test 1 | ✅ Passed | Savings rate 100% | Lower savings rate multiplier |
| Test 2 | ✅ Passed | Savings rate 100% | Same as above |
| Test 3 | ✅ Passed | None | Field mapping works correctly |
| Test 4 | ✅ Passed | Savings rate 100% | Same as above |
| Test 5 | ✅ Passed | None | Zero income handled well |
| Test 6 | ✅ Passed | None | Tax rates correct |
| Test 7 | ✅ Passed | Overall score 87 | Slightly high but acceptable |
| Test 8 | ✅ Passed | Overall score 93 | High net worth score appropriate |
| Test 9 | ❌ Failed | Score 82 (expect 30-60) | Adjust young professional scoring |
| Test 10 | ❌ Failed | Retirement < 50% | Fix retirement readiness calculation |

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. Immediate (Critical)
```javascript
// In financialHealthEngine.js calculateSavingsRateScore()
function calculateSavingsRateScore(inputs) {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // More realistic scoring curve
    if (savingsRate < 10) {
        score = savingsRate * 3; // 0-30 points for 0-10%
    } else if (savingsRate < 20) {
        score = 30 + (savingsRate - 10) * 4; // 30-70 points for 10-20%
    } else if (savingsRate < 30) {
        score = 70 + (savingsRate - 20) * 2; // 70-90 points for 20-30%
    } else {
        score = 90 + Math.min(10, (savingsRate - 30) * 0.5); // 90-100 for 30%+
    }
}
```

### 2. High Priority
```javascript
// Age-adjusted scoring for young professionals
function adjustScoreForAge(baseScore, age) {
    if (age < 30) {
        // Young professionals get credit for starting early
        return baseScore * 0.7 + 20; // Baseline boost but capped
    } else if (age > 55) {
        // Near retirement needs higher standards
        return baseScore * 1.1;
    }
    return baseScore;
}
```

### 3. Medium Priority
- Implement more sophisticated retirement projections
- Add inflation adjustments
- Consider investment returns in projections
- Factor in Social Security / National Insurance

## Test Suite Improvements

1. **Add Visual Tests**: The current tests only check calculations, not UI
2. **Add Persistence Tests**: Verify data saves/loads correctly
3. **Add Navigation Tests**: Ensure wizard flow works properly
4. **Add Validation Tests**: Check input validation (negative numbers, etc.)

## Conclusion

The core functionality works well - field mapping, multi-currency support, and basic calculations are solid. The main issues are with the scoring algorithms being too generous for young professionals and too harsh for pre-retirees. With the recommended adjustments, the scoring system will provide more realistic and helpful feedback to users.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement the savings rate scoring fix
2. Adjust retirement readiness calculation
3. Add age-based scoring adjustments
4. Re-run all tests to verify improvements
