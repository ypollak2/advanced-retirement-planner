# TICKET-RSU-STOCK-ENHANCEMENT: Enhance RSU Input with Stock Symbol and Dynamic Price Lookup

## Status: COMPLETED

## Summary
Enhance the RSU input functionality in WizardStepSalary to include stock symbol selection and dynamic price lookup. The good news is that most infrastructure already exists - we have a comprehensive stock price API utility and an EnhancedRSUCompanySelector component that just needs to be integrated.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Integrate EnhancedRSUCompanySelector into WizardStepSalary ✅
- [x] Replace the current basic RSU input fields with the EnhancedRSUCompanySelector component
- [x] Add RSU units input field
- [x] Keep frequency selector
- [x] Display calculated RSU value (units × price)

### 2. Update RSU Calculation Logic ✅
- [x] Modify the RSU tax calculations in additionalIncomeTax.js to use actual stock prices
- [x] Update the calculation formula:
  - Current: `quarterlyRSU * 4` (assumes RSU amount is dollar value)
  - New: `rsuUnits * rsuCurrentStockPrice * frequency_multiplier`
  - Where frequency_multiplier = 12 (monthly), 4 (quarterly), or 1 (yearly)

### 3. UI Enhancements in WizardStepSalary ✅
- [x] Add new input fields:
  - `rsuCompany`: Stock symbol (handled by EnhancedRSUCompanySelector)
  - `rsuCurrentStockPrice`: Current stock price (handled by EnhancedRSUCompanySelector)
  - `rsuUnits`: Number of RSU units
- [x] Display calculated RSU value: units × price
- [x] Show price source (API/fallback/manual) and last updated time (in EnhancedRSUCompanySelector)

### 4. Update Income Summary Display ✅
- [x] Enhance the total income calculation to show:
  - RSU units and stock symbol
  - Current stock price with update timestamp (in EnhancedRSUCompanySelector)
  - Total RSU value (units × price)
  - Net RSU income after tax
- [x] Added RSU details display in income summary

### 5. Add Partner RSU Support ✅
- [x] For couple planning mode, add the same RSU enhancements for partner income
- [x] Use fields: `partnerRsuCompany`, `partnerRsuUnits`, `partnerRsuCurrentStockPrice`
- [x] Added simplified stock symbol input and manual price entry for partners
- [x] Display partner RSU details in income summary

### 6. Testing ✅
- [x] Test with various stock symbols
- [x] Test offline mode with fallback prices
- [x] Test manual price entry
- [x] Test tax calculations with new RSU values
- [x] Test partner RSU functionality
