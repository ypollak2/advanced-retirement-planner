## Overview

Version 6.5.0 introduces professional-grade financial intelligence features that transform the Advanced Retirement Planner into a comprehensive wealth management tool. These features provide institutional-level analysis capabilities for individual investors.

## Advanced Portfolio Intelligence

### 🎯 Advanced Portfolio Rebalancing

**File**: `src/utils/advancedRebalancing.js` & `src/components/AdvancedRebalancingPanel.js`

**Features**:
- **Rebalancing Triggers**: Threshold-based, time-based, and market condition triggers
- **Tax Optimization**: Tax-loss harvesting and asset location optimization
- **Urgency Assessment**: Color-coded priority system (red=critical, orange=high, yellow=medium, green=low)
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Transaction costs vs rebalancing benefits
- **Automation**: Scheduled rebalancing with customizable frequencies

**Usage**:
```javascript
// Calculate rebalancing recommendations
const rebalanceAnalysis = window.analyzePortfolioRebalancing(
    inputs, 
    currentAllocation, 
    targetAllocation, 
    'israel'
);

// Returns: urgency, recommendations, tax implications, costs
```

### 🎲 Monte Carlo Simulations

**File**: `src/utils/monteCarloSimulation.js` & `src/components/MonteCarloResultsDashboard.js`

**Features**:
- **10,000+ Simulations**: Statistically significant sample size
- **Economic Scenarios**: Bull market, bear market, recession, stagflation
- **Risk Metrics**: Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall, Maximum Drawdown
- **Success Probability**: Probability of meeting retirement goals
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Histogram, time series, and risk analysis views

**Key Metrics**:
- Success Probability (target: >80%)
- Shortfall Risk (target: <20%)
- Median Portfolio Value at Retirement
- 95% Confidence Intervals

### 📈 Inflation Impact Analysis

**File**: `src/utils/inflationCalculations.js` & `src/components/InflationVisualizationPanel.js`

**Features**:
- **Real vs Nominal Tracking**: Purchasing power analysis over time
- **Inflation Protection Score**: Asset inflation hedge effectiveness (0-100%)
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Optimistic (2.0%), Moderate (2.5%), Pessimistic (3.2%), Historical (2.1%)
- **Asset-Specific Analysis**: Different inflation impacts for stocks, bonds, real estate, crypto

**Inflation Protection Scoring**:
- **Excellent (70%+)**: Strong inflation hedge
- **Good (50-70%)**: Moderate protection
- **Poor (<50%)**: Limited protection

### 💰 Systematic Withdrawal Strategies

**File**: `src/utils/withdrawalStrategies.js` & `src/components/WithdrawalStrategyInterface.js`

**Six Withdrawal Methods**:

1. **Fixed Dollar Amount**: Constant withdrawal adjusted for inflation
2. **Fixed Percentage (4% Rule)**: Traditional 4% withdrawal rate
3. **Total Return Strategy**: Withdraw interest and dividends first
4. **Bucket Strategy**: Time-based asset buckets (short/medium/long term)
5. **Dynamic Withdrawal**: Adjust based on portfolio performance
6. **Floor and Ceiling**: Minimum/maximum withdrawal bounds

**Israeli Tax Optimization**:
- Tax-efficient withdrawal sequencing
- Capital gains vs ordinary income optimization
- Timing strategies for tax minimization

## Tax Optimization Engine

### 🏛️ Comprehensive Tax Analysis

**File**: `src/utils/taxOptimization.js` & `src/components/TaxOptimizationPanel.js`

**Features**:
- **Personal Tax Situation Analysis**: Income-based optimization
- **2025 Israeli Tax Brackets**: Updated rates and thresholds
- **Training Fund Optimization**: Threshold logic for high earners
- **Multi-Country Support**: Israel, USA, Eurozone tax strategies

**Tax Brackets (Israel 2025)**:
- 10% on income up to ₪81,480
- 14% on income ₪81,481 - ₪116,760
- 20% on income ₪116,761 - ₪187,440
- 31% on income ₪187,441 - ₪241,680
- 35% on income ₪241,681 - ₪504,360
- 47% on income above ₪504,360

### Dynamic Return Assumptions

**File**: `src/utils/dynamicReturnAssumptions.js` & `src/components/DynamicReturnPanel.js`

**Market Scenarios**:
- **Conservative**: 5.5% pension, 5.0% training fund, 6.0% portfolio
- **Moderate**: 7.0% pension, 6.5% training fund, 8.0% portfolio  
- **Aggressive**: 8.5% pension, 8.0% training fund, 10.0% portfolio

**Features**:
- Historical validation against market data
- Time-based adjustments for market cycles
- Economic condition modeling

## Advanced UX Components

### 📊 Settings Panel

**File**: `src/components/AdvancedSettingsPanel.js`

**Centralized Configuration**:
- **General Settings**: Language, currency, country, risk tolerance
- **Rebalancing**: Automation, frequency, thresholds
- **Inflation**: Rate assumptions, scenarios, protection targets
- **Monte Carlo**: Simulation count, projection years, confidence levels
- **Withdrawal**: Default strategy, rates, tax optimization
- **Tax Settings**: Optimization toggles, loss harvesting
