## üéØ High-Impact UX Improvements

**Current Issue**: Users must complete entire 10-step wizard before seeing any calculations  
**Impact**: High abandonment rate, no immediate value demonstration  
**User Pain**: "I've entered all this data but don't know if it's working"

**Recommended Solution**:
```
Step 1-2: Basic demographics ‚Üí Show simple projection preview
Step 3-4: Add savings data ‚Üí Update preview with current status

Step 7-8: Advanced planning ‚Üí Full detailed projections
```

**Recommended Solution**:
- **Country-based defaults**: Auto-populate pension rates by location
- **Salary-based suggestions**: Suggest typical savings rates by income level

**Benefits**:

## üß† Cognitive Load Reduction

### CL-001: Information Architecture Restructuring
**Current Issue**: Step 3 (Current Savings) shows 8+ input fields simultaneously

**Recommended Restructure**:
```
Instead of: [All savings fields at once]

Implement:
Step 3A: "Do you have existing pension savings?" ‚Üí If yes, show pension fields
Step 3B: "Do you have training fund savings?" ‚Üí If yes, show training fund fields  
Step 3C: "Do you have personal investments?" ‚Üí If yes, show investment fields
Step 3D: "Summary of your current savings" ‚Üí Show aggregated view
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces overwhelm

- More accurate data entry

### CL-002: Smart Form Flow with Conditional Logic

- **Experience-based**: Beginner vs Advanced mode toggle
