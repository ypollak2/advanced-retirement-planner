## Technical Implementation

### 1. Field Mapping Dictionary
Created comprehensive field mapping system with:
- **30+ field categories** covering all financial data types
- **200+ field name variations** mapped to canonical names
- **Intelligent normalization** for case/format differences
- **Smart suggestions** when exact matches not found

### 2. Enhanced getFieldValue Function
- **Phase 0:** Field mapping dictionary lookup (NEW)
- **Phase 1:** Direct field lookup
- **Phase 2:** Partner field combination
- **Phase 3:** Fallback patterns
- **Phase 4:** Wizard-specific structures

### 3. Improved Logging
- No more "Fallback Activated" warnings for mapped fields
- Helpful suggestions when fields genuinely missing
- Clear distinction between missing data vs. mapping issues

## Key Improvements

### Before (Field Mapping Issues)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback Activated: No value found for fields: [trainingFundContributionRate, trainingFundEmployeeRate...]. Defaulting to 0.
CRITICAL: A key financial field was not found. This will significantly impact score accuracy.
```

### After (Perfect Field Detection)
```
‚úÖ Found field "trainingFundRateEmployee" (mapped from "trainingFundEmployeeRate"): 2.5
‚úÖ Found Portfolio: 50000
‚úÖ Found Emergency Fund: 30000
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
